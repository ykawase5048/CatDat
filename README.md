_A comprehensive and searchable database of categories and their properties_

<https://catdat.app>

## Features

- **Searchable Database**: Easily find [categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) based on properties and non-properties.
- **Deduction System**: Automatically infers properties from existing ones, powered by a database of implications.
- **Reason/Reference for Implications**: Each implication has a reason/reference, providing a data-based knowledge base of category theory.
- **Automatic Dualization**: Automatically dualizes implications.
- **Comprehensive Definitions**: Detailed definitions of properties and categories.
- **Comparison Feature**: Compare multiple categories to see their differences.
- **Find Related Categories**: Discover categories related to your search.
- **Customizable Display**: Light/dark mode, show/hide deduced properties.
- **References to nLab**: Links to the [nLab](https://ncatlab.org) for detailed information.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Easy to use on both mobile and desktop.

## Similar projects

- **[Catabase](https://catabase.fly.dev)**: A similar project that appears to be abandoned. It is more ambitious in terms of available data types but less complete for basic categories. The UI is not very intuitive, and it lacks an integrated deduction system between properties. See the [nForum announcement](https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/13419/catabase-a-database-of-categories/).
- **[nLab](https://ncatlab.org)**: A wiki for (higher) category theory. _CatDat_ refers to nLab pages for detailed information on its entries.
- **[Clowder Project](https://clowderproject.com)**: A new online reference for category theory. Unlike _CatDat_, which is data-based, Clowder follows a textbook-based approach.
- **[Database of Ring Theory](https://ringtheory.herokuapp.com/)**: This database focuses on ring theory and module theory rather than category theory, but is very similar in nature and was a major inspiration for _CatDat_.
