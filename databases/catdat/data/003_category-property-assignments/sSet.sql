So there is a morphism $X \to Y$ for trivial reasons. If $X_0$ is non-empty, pick an element. By the Yoneda Lemma it corresponds to a morphism $\Delta^0 \to X$. Since $\Delta^0 = 1$ is terminal, there is a morphism $Y \to \Delta^0$, and these compose to a morphism $Y \to X$.'

Assume that such a simplicial set $F$ exists.  By using the sequence of $n$-skeletons of $F$, we see that there is some $n$ such that every $n$-simplex in $F$ is degenerate.
