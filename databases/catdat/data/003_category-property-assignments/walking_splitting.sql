	'We can define $\mathrm{id}_1 + \mathrm{id}_1 := ip$ (and it is clear how to add zero morphisms) and then verify that the axioms of a preadditive category hold. Alternatively, it suffices to find a preadditive category which is isomorphic to the walking splitting: Consider the full subcategory of $\mathbf{Vect}_{\IF_2}$ that consists only of the trivial vector space $\{0\}$ and $\IF_2$. Since $\mathbf{Vect}_{\IF_2}$ is preadditive, it is preadditive as well. It has two objects, two identities, the morphisms $i : \{0\} \to \IF_2$, $p : \IF_2 \to \{0\}$, and the zero morphism $ip : \IF_2 \to \IF_2$. Clearly, $pi$ is the identity.'

	'We work with the representation of the category as $\mathbf{Vect}^{\leq 1}_{\IF_2}$, the category of vector spaces over $\IF_2$ of dimension $\leq 1$. It suffices to show that it is closed under sifted colimits in $\mathbf{Vect}_{\IF_2}$. More generally, we show this for $\mathbf{Vect}^{\leq d}_K \subseteq \mathbf{Vect}_K$, where $d \in \IN$ and $K$ is a field. So let  $X : \I \to \mathbf{Vect}_K$ be a sifted diagram with colimit $(u_i : X_i \to X_\infty)_{i \in \I}$. Since $\I$ is sifted, for finitely many objects $i_1,\dotsc,i_n \in \I$ there is an object $k$ that admits morphisms $i_1 \to k, \dotsc, i_n \to k$; this is all we need to know about $\I$. Assume that each $X_i$ is of dimension $\leq d$, we need to show this for $X_\infty$ as well.<br>
	Every element in $X_\infty$ is a finite sum of elements of the form $u_i(x_i)$ with $x_i \in X_i$. Choose an object $k$ with morphisms $i \to k$ for every occurring $i$. If $y_i \in X_k$ denotes the image of $x_i$, we get $\sum_i u_i(x_i) = \sum_i u_k(y_i) = u_k(\sum_i y_i)$. Therefore, every element of $X_\infty$ has the form $u_i(x_i)$ for some $i \in \I$ and $x_i \in X_i$. Moreover, for finitely many elements in $X_\infty$ the index $i$ may be chosen uniformly.<br>
	Now, if $X_\infty$ has dimension $> d$, it would have linearly independent vectors $v_0,\dotsc,v_d$, all of which have a preimage in $X_i$ for some $i \in \I$. But then these preimages would be linearly independent as well, which contradicts $\dim(X_i) \leq d$.'

	'Again we work with $\mathbf{Vect}^{\leq 1}_{\IF_2}$. We already know that it has sifted colimits and that the embedding to $\mathbf{Vect}_{\IF_2}$ preserves them. The object $0$ is initial and hence strongly finitely presentable. The object $\IF_2$ is strongly finitely presentable in $\mathbf{Vect}^{\leq 1}_{\IF_2}$ since its hom-functor is the composition of the embedding and the forgetful functor $\mathbf{Vect}_{\IF_2} \to \mathbf{Set}$, and the latter preserves sifted colimits by <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/8/n3/8-03abs.html" target="_blank">[AR01, Lemma 3.3]</a> applied to $\IF_2 \in \mathbf{Vect}_{\IF_2}$.'
