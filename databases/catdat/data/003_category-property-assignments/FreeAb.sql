Every homomorphism $f  : A \to B$ in $\FreeAb$ factors as $f = i \circ p : A \twoheadrightarrow C \hookrightarrow B$, where $C$ is a subgroup, hence free, and $A \to C$ is surjective. Clearly, surjective homomorphisms are pullback-stable. It remains to show that they coincide with the regular epimorphisms.<br>
	(1) If $f : A \to B$ is surjective, it is the coequalizer of $A \times_B A \rightrightarrows A$ in $\Ab$. Since $A \times_B A$ is free abelian, $f$ is also an coequalizer in $\FreeAb$.<br>
	(2) If $f : A \to B$ is a regular epimorphism in $\FreeAb$, consider the factorization $f = i \circ p$ as above. Since $f$ is an extremal epimorphism, $i$ must be an isomorphism, so that $f$ is surjective.'
