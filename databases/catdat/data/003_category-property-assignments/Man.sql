	'To construct countable coproducts, take the usual disjoint union of spaces, which is clearly locally Euclidean and Hausdorff, and it is second countable since we are using only countable many spaces. (Without that condition, all coproducts would exist.) Now we need to check that the canonical smooth map $\coprod_i X \times Y_i \to X \times \coprod_i Y_i$ is a diffeomorphism (for countable families). It is a homeomorphism since $\mathbf{Top}$ is infinitary distributive. The inverse $X \times \coprod_i Y_i \to \coprod_i X \times Y_i$ is smooth since the domain is covered by the open subsets $X \times Y_i$ on which the map is clearly smooth.'

In particular, there is a countable atlas. It is then completely determined by countable many open subsets of Euclidean spaces and the transition maps.'

	'Let $p : X + X \twoheadrightarrow E$ be a cocongruence with coreflexivity morphism $r : E \to X$, so that $r \circ p : X + X \to X$ is the codiagonal. Since $p$ is an epimorphism, it has dense image (see below). We first claim that in fact $p$ also has closed image and therefore is surjective.
	Because $r \circ (p \circ i_1) : X \to X$ is the identity, the image of $p \circ i_1$ is the equalizer of $\mathrm{id}_E$ and $(p \circ i_1) \circ r$, hence closed. Likewise, the image of $p \circ i_2$ is closed. Thus, the image of $p$, which is the union of these images, is closed.<br>
	Now, since the pushforward maps of tangent spaces compose to the identity, we see that $p$ must be a local immersion and $r$ must be a submersion.  Also, since the fibers of $r$ have one or two points each, we see that the dimension of $E$ must locally be the same as the dimension of $X$.  This implies that in fact $p$ and $r$ are local diffeomorphisms.  Therefore, the cardinality of the fiber of $r$ is locally constant.  Thus, if $U$ is the subset of $X$ where $r$ has fiber of a single point, with the subspace topology, then $U$ is a clopen submanifold of $X$ which serves as the equalizer of $p \circ i_1$ and $p \circ i_2$.'

	'The power $\IR^{\IN}$ does not exist. More generally, let $(M_n)_{n \geq 0}$ be a sequence of smooth manifolds of positive dimension whose product $(\pi_n : P \to M_n)_{n \geq 0}$ exists. This product cone in $\mathbf{Man}$ yields a product cone in $\mathbf{Set}$ since the forgetful functor $\mathbf{Man} \to \mathbf{Set}$ is representable, hence preserves all limits. Choose points $x_n \in M_n$ with $T_{x_n}(M_n) \neq 0$. Choose the point $x \in P$ with $\pi_n(x) = x_n$. Consider the linear map $T_x(P) \to \prod_{n \geq 0} T_{x_n}(M_n)$ induced by the derivatives $d_x(\pi_n) : T_x(P) \to T_{x_n}(M_n)$. Since $T_x(P)$ is finite-dimensional and $\prod_{n \geq 0} T_{x_n}(M_n)$ is not, it cannot be surjective. But actually, it is: Choose tangent vectors $v_n \in T_{x_n}(M_n)$. Choose smooth curves $\gamma_n : \IR \to M_n$ with $\gamma_n(0)=x_n$ and ${\gamma_n}''(0) = v_n$. By the universal property there is a unique smooth curve $\gamma : \IR \to P$ with $\pi_n \gamma = \gamma_n$. In particular, $\gamma(0) = x$. The chain rule now implies that $\gamma''(0) \in T_x(P)$ is a preimage of $(v_n)$ – a contradiction.'
