This exactly means $f^*(A)=g^*(A)$ for all finite subsets $A \subseteq Y$. Applying this to $A = \{f(x)\}$ for $x \in X$ we get $x \in f^*(\{f(x)\}) = g^*(\{f(x)\})$, so that $g(x) = f(x)$.'

The disjoint union $X+Y$ of two sets $X,Y$ with the inclusion maps $X \rightarrow X+Y \leftarrow Y$ is a coproduct: The inclusions are injective, hence finite-to-one. If $f : X \to T$, $g : Y \to T$ are finite-to-one maps, the induced map $(f;g) : X + Y \to T$ is finite-to-one since the fiber of $t \in T$ is $f^*(\{t\}) + g^*(\{t\})$, which is finite. Hence, finite coproducts exist. A map $A \to X + Y$ yields a decomposition $A = A_X + A_Y$ with maps $A_X \to X$, $A_Y \to Y$ (since $\mathbf{Set}$ is extensive).

These maps are finite-to-one since $p_i^*(\{y\}) \cong f^*(\{y\})$ for $i=1,2$, and their coequalizer is also $f$ in $\mathbf{Set}_\mathrm{f}$: It suffices to observe that if $h : Y \to T$ is a map such that $h \circ f$ is finite-to-one, then $h$ is finite-to-one as well.

	'We first show that $\aleph_1$-directed colimits exist and are preserved by the forgetful functor to $\mathbf{Set}$. Let $(X_i)_{i \in I}$ be a diagram in $\mathbf{Set}_\mathrm{f}$ indexed by a $\aleph_1$-directed poset $I$. Let $(u_i : X_i \to X)$ be the colimit in $\mathbf{Set}$. Each map $u_i$ is finite-to-one: Otherwise, some fiber $u_i^*(\{x\}) \subseteq X_i$ contains infinitely many elements $a_1,a_2,\dotsc$. For every $n \geq 1$ we find $i_n \geq i$ such that $a_1,a_n$ have the same image in $X_{i_n}$. Let $i_\infty \in I$ be an upper bound of all $i_n$. Then all $a_n$ have the same image in $X_{i_\infty}$. This is a contradiction since $X_i \to X_{i_\infty}$ is finite-to-one. Now if $f : X \to Y$ is a map such that each $f \circ u_i$ is finite-to-one, then $f$ is finite-to-one as well: If a fiber $f^*(\{y\})$ contains infinitely many distinct elements $x_1,x_2,\dotsc$, there is some index $i$ such that all have a preimage in $X_i$, but then $(f \circ u_i)^*(\{y\})$ would be infinite. This concludes the proof that $\aleph_1$-directed colimits exist.<br>
	In $\mathbf{Set}$, every set $X$ is the $\aleph_1$-directed colimit of its countable subsets. This remains true in $\mathbf{Set}_\mathrm{f}$ because a map $X \to Y$ is finite-to-one as long as each restriction to a countable subset of $X$ is finite-to-one. Moreover, every countable set is $\aleph_1$-presentable in $\mathbf{Set}$, but also in $\mathbf{Set}_\mathrm{f}$.'

In fact, the forgetful functor to $\mathbf{Set}$ is representable, so it must preserve products. This means we can assume $X \times Y$ is the usual cartesian product with the usual projections. Since $p_1 : X \times Y \to X$ is finite-to-one and $X$ is non-empty, $Y$ is finite. By symmetric, also $X$ is finite.

Applying this to $j : \IN \to 1$, we see that $X$ is finite. Applying the universal property to maps $j : \IN \to \{0,1\}$, we see that for every subset $E \subseteq \IN$ there is a unique finite subset $F \subseteq X$ with $i^*(F) = E$. But finiteness of $F$ is automatic, so $i^* : P(X) \to P(\IN)$ is bijective. But then $P(\IN)$ is finite, which is absurd.'

This describes the category of cocones, and we need to show that it has no multi-initial object. To this end, we claim that the connected component of the unique map $! : \IN \to 1$ consists precisely of the maps $f : \IN \to X$ with finite image. Once that is established, we can recycle the proof for missing coproducts since there we have only used finite codomains.<br>
	Let $g = h \circ f$ be as above. If $\mathrm{im}(f)$ is finite, then $\mathrm{im}(g) = h_*(\mathrm{im}(f))$ is finite as well. Conversely, if $\mathrm{im}(g)$ is finite, then $\mathrm{im}(f) \subseteq \bigcup_{y \in \mathrm{im}(g)} h^*(\{y\})$ is finite as well. This shows that the connected component of $!$ is contained in the collection of maps with finite image. Conversely, if $f$ has finite image, then there is a morphism from the corestriction $f'' : \IN \to \mathrm{im}(f)$ to $f$, and also a morphism from $f''$ to $!$. This proves the remaining inclusion.'
