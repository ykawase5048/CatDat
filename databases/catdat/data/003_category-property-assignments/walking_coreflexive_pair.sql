The first two have the same coequalizer (if it exists) since $p$ is an epimorphism, the last two are symmetric, and we already remarked that $p$ is a coequalizer of $(\id,ip)$. So it suffices to check that $p$ is a coequalizer of $i,j$, which is easy.'

This amounts to a universal totally ordered set of cardinality $\leq 2$ with elements $a,b,c$ satisfying $a \leq b$, $a \leq c$. Since a finite totally ordered set has trivial automorphism group, the automorphism defined by $a \mapsto a$, $b \mapsto c$, $c \mapsto b$ must be the identity, i.e., we have $b = c$.
