# The database of _CatDat_

## Overview

_CatDat_ is based on a [SQLite database](https://sqlite.org/). During runtime of the application, it is read-only.

The local copy of the database is located at `/database/local.db`. It has three main tables:

- `categories`
- `properties`
- `implications`

To associate properties with categories (satisfied or not), there is a table:

- `category_property_assignments`

To mark properties as assumptions or conclusions of an implication, there are two tables:

- `implication_assumptions`
- `implication_conclusions`

But they are abstracted away by using the view `implications_view`.

Further tables are:

- `tags`
- `category_tags`
- `related_categories`
- `prefixes`
- `special_object_types`
- `special_objects`
- `special_morphism_types`
- `special_morphisms`
- `related_properties`
- `category_comments`

## Migrations vs. Data

Migrations update the database structure: tables, views, indexes, and triggers. They are defined in SQL files located in the subfolder [/database/migrations](/database/migrations/). The command `pnpm db:migrate` applies any new migrations.

Database entries (categories, properties, implications, etc.) are defined via SQL files in the subfolder [/database/data](/database/data). The command `pnpm db:seed` replaces the current database by clearing all existing data and inserting the entries defined in these SQL files.

## Derived Data

From the defined satisfied properties of a given category, new properties can be automatically deduced using the implications. (For example, when a category has equalizers and products, we can infer that it is complete.) The same applies to unsatisfied properties. Additionally, suitable implications may be dualized. Note that the SQL files mentioned above do _not_ contain any derived data.

The command `pnpm db:deduce` deduces implications, satisfied properties, and unsatisfied properties.

## Test Data

The command `pnpm db:test` executes some tests and verifies that the data behaves as expected.

## One command for everything

Use `pnpm db:update` to run all the commands in sequence: `pnpm db:migrate`, `pnpm db:seed`,`pnpm db:deduce`, and `pnpm db:test`.

Use `pnpm db:watch` to run this command automatically every time a file in the subfolder [/database/data](/database/data) changes. This is useful in particular during development.
