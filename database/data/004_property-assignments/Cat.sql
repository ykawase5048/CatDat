This means that $F(f) = G(f)$ for all morphisms $f : X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{C}$. By comparing the domains and applying this to $f = \mathrm{id}_X$, we see that $F(X) = G(X)$ for all objects $X$.

It is represented by $B \mathbb{N}$, the one-object category associated to the free monoid in one generator. Consider the relation $R \subseteq U^2$ consisting of those pairs $((x,u),(y,v))$ where $x = y$ and $uv = u^2$. This also representable, namely be the one-object category associated to the monoid with the presentation $\langle u,v : uv = u^2 \rangle$. Clearly, $R$ is reflexive, but not symmetric.'

The delooping functor $B : \mathbf{Mon} \to \mathbf{Cat}$ has a left adjoint (<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/574745" target="_blank">MSE/574745</a>), hence it preserves regular monomorphisms. It also preserves pushouts (<a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/5130854" target="_blank">MSE/5130854</a>), and it reflects monomorphisms since it is faithful. Therefore, $B(M) \to B(N)$ provides the desired counterexample of a non-stable regular monomorphism of categories.'
