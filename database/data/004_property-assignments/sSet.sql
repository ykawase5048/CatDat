For all $n,m$ there is a morphism $[n] \to [m]$ in $\Delta$ and hence a morphism $\Delta^m \to \Delta^n$ in $\mathbf{sSet}$. Therefore, $\coprod_{n \geq 0} \Delta^n$ is a generator (see the proof of <a href="/category-implication/generator_via_coproduct">this implication</a>).'

So there is a morphism $X \to Y$ for trivial reasons. If $X_0$ is non-empty, pick an element. By the Yoneda Lemma it corresponds to a morphism $\Delta^0 \to X$. Since $\Delta^0 = 1$ is terminal, there is a morphism $Y \to \Delta^0$, and these compose to a morphism $Y \to X$.'

Assume that such a simplicial set $F$ exists.  By using the sequence of $n$-skeletons of $F$, we see that there is some $n$ such that every $n$-simplex in $F$ is degenerate. Now take $X = \Delta^n$, which has a non-degenerate $n$-simplex. Then there cannot be an epimorphism $\coprod_{s \in S} F \to X$.'
