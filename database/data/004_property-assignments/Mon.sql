	'Consider the monoid $M := \langle x_0, x_1, s : x_0 s = x_1 s = 1 \rangle$. Notice that every element in $M$ has a unique expression as $s^k \cdot u$ with $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $u \in \langle x_0,x_1 \rangle_M$. Moreover, the canonical homomorphism $\iota : \langle x_0, x_1 \rangle \to M$ (from the free monoid) is injective. We will prove that it is a regular monomorphism, which however is not pushout-stable. Consider $N := \langle x_0, x_1, s_0, s_1 : x_i s_j = 1 \rangle$ and define $f_i : M \to N$ for $i=0,1$ by $f_i(x_j) = x_j$ and $f_i(s) = s_i$. Then $\iota$ is the equalizer of $f_0,f_1$. Now consider $g : \langle x_0,x_1 \rangle \to \langle y_0 \rangle$ defined by $g(x_0) = y_0$, $g(x_1) = 1$. The pushout of $\iota$ with $g$ is given by $\langle x_0, x_1, s, y_0 : x_0 s = x_1 s = 1 , \, x_0 = y_0, \, x_1 = 1 \rangle$, which simplifies to $\langle x_0, s : x_0 s = s = 1 \rangle$, which is trivial.'

Since the trivial monoid is a zero object, every regular submonoid $U \subseteq M$ of any monoid $M$ would have the form $\{m \in M : h(m) = 1 \}$ for some homomorphism $M \to \Omega$. Now take any monoid $M$ with zero that has two different homomorphisms with zero $f,g : M \rightrightarrows N$ (for example, let $M = N = \{0\} \cup \{x^n : n \geq 0\}$ be the free monoid with zero on one generator, $f(x) = 0$,and $g(x) = x$). Take their equalizer $U \subseteq M$, and choose a homomorphism $h : M \to \Omega$ with $U = \{m \in M : h(m) = 1\}$. Since $0 \in U$, we have $h(0)=1$. But then for all $m \in M$ we have $h(m) = h(m) h(0) = h(m 0) = h(0) = 1$, i.e. $U = M$, which yields the contradiction $f = g$.'

The same counterexample works here since the inclusion $\mathbf{Grp} \hookrightarrow \mathbf{Mon}$ preserves limits and colimits (it has a left and a right adjoint) and is conservative. A similar counterexample is given by the free monoids $N_n = \langle x_1,\dotsc,x_n \rangle$ and the Boolean monoid $M = \langle e : e^2=e \rangle$ with the maps $N_{n+1} \to N_n$, $x_{n+1} \mapsto 1$. Then the element $(x_1 e \cdots x_n e) \in \lim_n (M \sqcup N_n)$ does not come from $M \sqcup \lim_n N_n$ because its components have unbounded free product length.'
