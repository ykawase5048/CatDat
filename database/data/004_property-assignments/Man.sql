Now we need to check that the canonical smooth map $\coprod_i X \times Y_i \to X \times \coprod_i Y_i$ is a diffeomorphism (for countable families). It is a homeomorphism since $\mathbf{Top}$ is infinitary distributive. The inverse $X \times \coprod_i Y_i \to \coprod_i X \times Y_i$ is smooth since the domain is covered by the open subsets $X \times Y_i$ on which the map is clearly smooth.'

More generally, let $(M_n)_{n \geq 0}$ be a sequence of smooth manifolds of positive dimension whose product $(\pi_n : P \to M_n)_{n \geq 0}$ exists. This product cone in $\mathbf{Man}$ yields a product cone in $\mathbf{Set}$ since the forgetful functor $\mathbf{Man} \to \mathbf{Set}$ is representable, hence preserves all limits. Choose points $x_n \in M_n$ with $T_{x_n}(M_n) \neq 0$. Choose the point $x \in P$ with $\pi_n(x) = x_n$. Consider the linear map $T_x(P) \to \prod_{n \geq 0} T_{x_n}(M_n)$ induced by the derivatives $d_x(\pi_n) : T_x(P) \to T_{x_n}(M_n)$. Since $T_x(P)$ is finite-dimensional and $\prod_{n \geq 0} T_{x_n}(M_n)$ is not, it cannot be surjective. But actually, it is: Choose tangent vectors $v_n \in T_{x_n}(M_n)$. Choose smooth curves $\gamma_n : \mathbb{R} \to M_n$ with $\gamma_n(0)=x_n$ and ${\gamma_n}''(0) = v_n$. By the universal property there is a unique smooth curve $\gamma : \mathbb{R} \to P$ with $\pi_n \gamma = \gamma_n$. In particular, $\gamma(0) = x$. The chain rule now implies that $\gamma''(0) \in T_x(P)$ is a preimage of $(v_n)$ – a contradiction.'
