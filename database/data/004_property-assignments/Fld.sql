	'Consider a connected diagram $(F_i)$ of fields and take the limit $F$ in the category of commutative rings. Now one checks that $F$ is a field as well, and the universal property remains true for fields. Namely, $1 = 0$ in $F$ would imply that $1 = 0$ in each $F_i$ and hence, since the diagram is connected, in some $F_i$, which is a contradiction. And if $x \in F$ is non-zero, then all components $x_i$ are non-zero and hence invertible: Choose some $j$ such that $x_j$ is non-zero. Since there is a zig zag path of morphisms between $i$ and $j$ in the index category, which get mapped to field homomorphisms which are injective, it follows that $x_i$ is non-zero.'
