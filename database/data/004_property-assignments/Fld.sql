This is quite rare: Consider $E = K(X)$, $F = K(Y)$. Then $E \otimes_K F$ is isomorphic to $K[X,Y] (K[X]-\{0\})^{-1} (K[Y]-\{0\})^{-1}$, which is an integral domain but not a field: for example, $X-Y$ has no inverse.'

This poset is a lattice, and our assumption implies that it is distributive (see <a href="/category-implication/distributive_criterion">here</a>). But this is quite rare: Consider $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3})$. By Galois theory, the lattice of subfields is isomorphic to the diamond lattice $M_3$ which is not distributive. Specifically, $(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \wedge \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})) \vee (\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}) \wedge \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})) = \mathbb{Q} \vee \mathbb{Q} = \mathbb{Q}$, while $(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \vee \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})) \wedge \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}) \wedge \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$.'

In the first case, the two projections $P \rightrightarrows \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ must be equal, which means that every two homomorphisms $K \rightrightarrows \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ are equal, which is absurd (take $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and its two automorphisms). In the second case, the projections induce for every field $K$ a bijection $\mathrm{Hom}(K,\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})) \cong \mathrm{Hom}(K,\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}))^2$, which however fails for $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$: the left hand side has $2$ elements, the right hand side has $4$ elements.
