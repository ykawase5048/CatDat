	'Let $f : X \to Y$ be a monomorphism of locally ringed spaces. I claim that $f$ is injective, from which the claim will follow. The diagonal $\Delta : X \to X \times_Y X$ is an isomorphism. By the explicit construction of fiber products, $X \times_Y X$ consists of triples $(x_1,x_2,\mathfrak{p})$ where $x_1,x_2 \in X$, $y := f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ and $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal in $k(x_1) \otimes_{k(y)} k(x_2)$. The map $\Delta$ is given by $\Delta(x) = \bigl(x,x,\ker(k(x) \otimes_{k(f(x))} k(x) \to k(x)\bigr)$, and it is bijective. This clearly implies that $f$ is injective (and that each tensor product $k(x) \otimes_{k(f(x))} k(x)$ has a unique prime ideal, namely the kernel mentioned).'
