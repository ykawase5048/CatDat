The same example also works in $\mathbf{Haus}$: Surely $\mathbb{Q}$ is Hausdorff, $X_n$ is Hausdorff, as is their colimit $X$, and the colimit (taken in $\mathbf{Top}$) of the $X_n \times \mathbb{Q}$ admits a bijective continuous map to a Hausdorff space, therefore is also Hausdorff, meaning it is also the colimit taken in $\mathbf{Haus}$.'

That is, $X_n$ is the union of two lines $\mathbb{R} \times \{1\}$ and $\mathbb{R} \times \{2\}$ where we identify $(x,1) \equiv (x,2)$ when $|x| \leq 1/n$. Then $X_n$ is Hausdorff, and there is a canonical surjective continuous map $X_n \to X_{n+1}$. The colimit in $\mathbf{Top}$ is the union of two lines where we identify $(x,1) \equiv (x,2)$ when $|x| \leq 1/n$ for some $n$, i.e. when $x \neq 0$. This is the line with the double origin, which is not Hausdorff. Its Hausdorff reflection is the line $\mathbb{R}$ where all points of both lines are identified, and it provides the colimit in $\mathbf{Haus}$. Now, the injective continuous maps $\{1,2\} \to X_n$, $i \mapsto (0,i)$ (where $\{1,2\}$ is discrete) become the constant map $0 : \{1,2\} \to \mathbb{R}$ in the colimit, which is no monomorphism.'

If we take $X = 1$ we see that $\Omega$ has two points. Since $\Omega$ is Hausdorff, $\Omega \cong 1 + 1$ must be discrete. But then $\mathrm{Hom}(X,\Omega)$ is isomorphic to the set of all clopen subsets of $X$, of which there are usually far fewer than closed subsets (consider $X = [0,1]$).'
