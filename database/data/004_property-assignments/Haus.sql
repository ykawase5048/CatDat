The same example also works in $\mathbf{Haus}$: Surely $\mathbb{Q}$ is Hausdorff, $X_n$ is Hausdorff, as is their colimit $X$, and the colimit (taken in $\mathbf{Top}$) of the $X_n \times \mathbb{Q}$ admits a bijective continuous map to a Hausdorff space, therefore is also Hausdorff, meaning it is also the colimit taken in $\mathbf{Haus}$.'

If we take $X = 1$ we see that $\Omega$ has two points. Since $\Omega$ is Hausdorff, $\Omega \cong 1 + 1$ must be discrete. But then $\mathrm{Hom}(X,\Omega)$ is isomorphic to the set of all clopen subsets of $X$, of which there are usually far fewer than closed subsets (consider $X = [0,1]$).'
