It is fully faithful and has a left adjoint mapping a rng $R$ to the abelian group $R/R^2$. If $R$ is a rng with zero multiplication and $R \to S$ is a surjective homomorphism, then $S$ has zero multiplication. Therefore, the assumptions of <a href="/lemma/subobject_classifiers_coreflection">this lemma</a> (dualized) apply and we conclude that $P/P^2$ is a regular quotient object classifier of $\mathbf{Ab}$.

Every element in the coproduct of rngs $\mathbb{Z}[X] \sqcup \mathbb{Z}[[Y]]$ has a finite "free product" length. Now consider the elements

	Because of $w_n \equiv w_{n-1} \bmod Y^n$ these form an element $w \in \lim_n (A \sqcup B_n)$. Expanding $w_n$, the longest term is $XY XY^2 \cdots X Y^n$ of "free product" length $2n$, which is unbounded.'
