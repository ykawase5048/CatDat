Take an infinite field $F$ which is larger than $Q$ and admits a non-trivial automorphism (for example, a field of rational functions). Then every rng homomorphism $f : F \to Q$ is zero: If $e := f(1)$, then $e$ is idempotent and $f$ corestricts to a ring homomorphism $f : F \to eQ$. Since $F$ is a field but $f$ cannot be injective, we must have $eQ = 0$, so that $e = 0$ and $f = 0$. Since $Q$ cogenerates, this implies that all homomorphisms $F \to F$ are equal, a contradiction.'

In particular, it would be an ideal. Now take any pair of homomorphisms $f,g : S \rightrightarrows T$ in $\mathbf{Ring}$. Their equalizer $R \subseteq S$ is also the equalizer in $\mathbf{Rng}$, and it contains $1 \in S$. If it was an ideal, then $R = S$, and hence $f = g$, which is absurd.'
