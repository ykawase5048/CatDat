It remains to show that it is isometric. For $(x,y) \in X \oplus \lim_i Y_i$ the norm in the domain is $|x| + \sup_i |y_i|$, and the norm in the codomain is $\sup_i (|x| + |y_i|)$, and these clearly agree.'

	'We will exhibit a directed colimit of monomorphisms which is not a monomorphism. For $n \geq 1$ let $V_n$ be the Banach space with underlying vector space $\mathbb{C}$ and the norm $|x|_n := \frac{1}{n} |x|$. For $n \leq m$ the identity map provides a morphism $V_n \to V_m$, which is clearly a monomorphism (also an epimorphism by the way, but an isomorphism iff $n=m$). Let $V$ be the colimit of all $V_n$ in the category of semi-normed vector spaces. It is constructed as the colimit in the category of vector spaces with the semi-norm $|x| := \inf \{|x|_m : n \leq m \}$ for $x \in V_n$. So clearly, the semi-norm is zero. Hence, the colimit in the category of normed vector spaces is $0$. The colimit in the category of Banach spaces is its completion, also $0$. Thus, the monomorphisms $V_1 \to V_n$ become $V_1 \to 0$ in the colimit.'

For $X = \mathbb{C}$ this implies that there are exactly two vectors in $\Omega$ with norm $\leq 1$, which is absurd.

This is not an epimorphism (i.e., has no dense image) since the closure of the image is precisely $c_0$. So for example, $(1,1,\dotsc)$ is not contained in the closure of the image.'
