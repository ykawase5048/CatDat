	There are several equivalent conditions:
	<ol>
		<li>It is equivalent to the category of models of a many-sorted finitary algebraic theory.</li>
		<li>It is equivalent to the category of finite-product-preserving functors to $\mathbf{Set}$ from a small category with finite products (=Lawvere theory).</li>
		<li>It is equivalent to the Eilenberg&ndash;Moore category of a finitary (=filtered-colimit-preserving) monad on $\mathbf{Set}^S$ for some set $S$.</li>
		<li>It is equivalent to the Eilenberg&ndash;Moore category of a sifted-colimit-preserving monad on $\mathbf{Set}^S$ for some set $S$. (cf. [<a href="https://doi.org/10.2168/LMCS-8(3:14)2012" target="_blank">KR12</a>, Proposition 3.3])</li>
	</ol>
	A category satisfying this property is simply called a <i>variety</i> (of algebras) by some authors, although one should be aware that this term is sometimes used only for the one-sorted case.',
