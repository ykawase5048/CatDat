Equivalently, the category is equivalent to a locally small category. In contrast to being locally small, this condition is invariant under equivalences of categories. This is why we have added it to the database. For instance, every algebraic category is locally essentially small, but not necessarily locally small. This indicates that this is the "right" notion to work with.',
