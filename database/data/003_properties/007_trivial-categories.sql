	'A category is <i>trivial</i> if it is equivalent to the <a href="/category/1">trivial category</a>. Equivalently, there is an initial object $0$ such that for every object $A$ the unique morphism $0 \to A$ is an isomorphism. Notice that we do not demand that the category is <i>isomorphic</i> to the trivial category. As a consequence, every inhabited indiscrete category is trivial in our sense.',

	'A category is <i>essentially discrete</i> if it is equivalent to a discrete category. Equivalently, it is a thin groupoid. Notice that the nLab calls this property simply "discrete". In contrast to being discrete, this property is invariant under equivalences of categories. An essentially discrete category is the same as a <i>setoid</i> (a set equipped with an equivalence relation).',
