This shows that $R$ is left-total, and for right-total the argument is similar. By symmetry, this also holds for $S$. To show that $R$ is a function, assume $(a,b_1), (a,b_2) \in R$. Choose some $b_3 \in B$ with $(b_3,a) \in S$. It follows $(b_3,b_1) \in S \circ R = \mathrm{id}_A$, so $b_3 = b_1$. Similarly, $(b_3,b_2) \in S \circ R = \mathrm{id}_A$, so $b_3 = b_2$. This shows that $R$ is a function, i.e. left-unique. That $R$ is injective, i.e. right-unique, follows by symmetry. Finally, $R$ is surjective since it is right-total.'
