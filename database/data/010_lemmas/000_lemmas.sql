    'Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a <a href="/category-property/thin">thin</a> and <a href="/category-property/finitary_algebraic">finitary algebraic</a> category. Then $\mathcal{C} \simeq 1$ or $\mathcal{C} \simeq \{0 < 1\}$.',
    'Let $F : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathcal{C}$ denote the free algebra functor. Every object $A \in \mathcal{C}$ admits a regular epimorphism $F(X) \twoheadrightarrow A$ for some set $X$. But since $\mathcal{C}$ is thin, every regular epimorphism must be an isomorphism. Also, $F(X)$ is a coproduct of copies of $F(1)$, which means it is either the initial object $0$ or $F(1)$ itself (since $\mathcal{C}$ is thin). If $F(1) \cong 0$, then every object is isomorphic to the initial object $0$, and hence $\mathcal{C}$ is trivial. If not, then $\mathcal{C}$ has exactly two objects up to isomorphism, $0$ and $F(1)$, there is a morphism $0 \to F(1)$, but no morphism $F(1) \to 0$. Since $\mathcal{C}$ is thin, we conclude $\mathcal{C} \simeq \{0 \to 1\}$.'

    'Uniqueness of preadditive structures',
    'Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a preadditive category (or more generally, a category enriched in commutative monoids) with finite products and finite coproducts. Then for all objects $X,Y$ the canonical morphism
    <p>$\alpha : X \oplus Y \to X \times Y$</p>
    is an isomorphism. Moreover, the preadditive structure is <i>unique</i>: If $f,g : A \rightrightarrows B$ are morphisms, their sum
    <p>$f+g : A \to B$</p>
    is the composite of $(f,g) : A \to B \times B$, the inverse $\alpha^{-1} : B \oplus B \to B \times B$, and the codiagonal $\nabla : B \oplus B \to B$.',
    'The morphism $\alpha : X \oplus Y \to X \times Y$ is defined by the equations

    <p>$p_2 \circ \alpha \circ i_1 = 0,\quad p_1 \circ \alpha \circ i_2 = 0$.</p>
    It does not depend on the choice of preadditive structure since zero morphisms are unique. It is an isomorphism: Define
    <p>$\beta := i_1 \circ p_1  + i_2 \circ p_2 : X \times Y \to X \oplus Y$.</p>
    Then $\alpha \circ \beta = \mathrm{id}_{X \times Y}$ because
    <p>$p_1 \circ \alpha \circ \beta = p_1 \circ \alpha \circ i_1 \circ p_1 + p_1 \circ \alpha \circ i_2 \circ p_2 = \mathrm{id}_1 \circ p_1 + 0 \circ p_2 = p_1$</p>
    and likewise $p_2 \circ \alpha \circ \beta = p_2$. We also have $\beta \circ \alpha = \mathrm{id}_{X \oplus Y}$ with a very similar calculation that shows $\beta \circ \alpha \circ i_1 = i_1$ and $\beta \circ \alpha \circ i_2 = i_2$.
    <p>Therefore, for morphisms $f,g : A \rightrightarrows B$ the composite $A \to B$ in the claim is equal to</p>

    'This is a straight forward generalization of <a href="/category-implication/generator_via_coproduct">this result</a>. We remark that the assumption about $S$ implies that each inclusion $G \to U$ has a left inverse. Now let $f,g : A \rightrightarrows B$ be two morphisms with $f h = g h$ for all $h : U \to A$. If $G \in S$, any morphism $G \to A$ extends to $U$ by our preliminary remark. Thus, $fh = gh$ holds for all $h : G \to A$ and $G \in S$. Since $S$ is a generating set, this implies $f = g$.'

    'Let $\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}$ be two categories. Assume that $\mathcal{D}$ is inhabited. If $\mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{D}$ has limits of a given shape, then $\mathcal{C}$ also has limits of this shape.',
    'Let $U \in \mathcal{D}$ be a fixed object. Assume that $X : \mathcal{J} \to \mathcal{C}$ is a diagram.

Clearly, $(p_i : L \to X_i)$ is a cone over $X$. We prove that it is universal:<br>
    Let $(f_i : T \to X_i)$ be a cone over $X$. Then $((f_i,\mathrm{id}_U) : (T,U) \to (X_i,U))$ is a cone over $(X,U)$. Hence, there is a unique morphism $(f,v) : (T,U) \to (L,V)$, consisting of $f : T \to L$ and $v : U \to V$, such that $(p_i,u_i) \circ (f,v) = (f_i,\mathrm{id}_U)$, i.e. $p_i \circ f = f_i$ and $u_i \circ v = \mathrm{id}_U$. If $g : T \to L$ is another morphism with $p_i \circ g = f_i$, then uniqueness applied to $(g,v)$ shows that $f = g$.'

We claim that $f_{i_0},g_{i_0} : A_{i_0} \rightrightarrows B_{i_0}$ are coequalized by all morphisms $B_{i_0} \to Q_{i_0}$, and hence are equal: Indeed, for all $i \neq i_0$ we may choose some morphism $B_i \to Q_i$ since $Q_i$ is weakly terminal. Thus, the morphism $B_{i_0} \to Q_{i_0}$ extends to a morphism $(B_i \to Q_i)_{i \in I}$ in the product category. By assumption, it coequalizes $(f_i)_{i \in I}$ and $(g_i)_{i \in I}$.

Assume that the sequence of morphisms $(X^n,a) : X^n \to X^{n+1}$ for $n \geq 0$ admits a colimit $(i_n : X^n \to C)$. Then for every $m \geq 0$ there is a split epimorphism $C \to X^m$. In particular, if $U : \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Set}$ is a functor preserving finite powers and $\mathrm{card}(U(X)) \geq 2$, then $U(C)$ is infinite.',
    'Let $m \geq 0$ be fixed. For $n \geq 0$ we define a morphism $u_n : X^n \to X^m$ as follows: It is the projection on the first $m$ factors for $m \leq n$, and $(X^n,a^{m-n})$ for $m \geq n$ (for $m=n$ these agree). With generalized elements this says:

    <p>$u_n(x_1,\dotsc,x_n) = u_{n+1}(x_1,\dotsc,x_n,a)$.</p>
    If $m \leq n$ (hence, $m \leq n+1$), both sides are equal to $(x_1,\dotsc,x_m)$. If $m > n$, i.e. $m \geq n+1$, both sides are equal to $(x_1,\dotsc,x_n,a,\dotsc,a)$. This proves the claim.
    <br>Hence, there is a unique morphism $\varphi : C \to X^m$ such that $\varphi \circ i_n = u_n$ for all $n \geq 0$. Since $u_m$ is the identity, $\varphi$ is a split epimorphism.
    <br>If $U$ is a functor with the mentioned properties, $U(\varphi)$ is also a split epimorphism from $U(C)$ to $U(X^m) \cong U(X)^m$, and $U(X)^m$ has $\geq 2^m$ elements. This holds for all $m$, so that $U(C)$ is infinite.'
