    'Algebraic categories are "never" thin',
    'Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a <a href="/category-property/thin">thin</a> and <a href="/category-property/finitary_algebraic">finitary algebraic</a> category. Then $\mathcal{C} \simeq 1$ or $\mathcal{C} \simeq \{0 < 1\}$.',
    'Let $F : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathcal{C}$ denote the free algebra functor. Every object $A \in \mathcal{C}$ admits a regular epimorphism $F(X) \twoheadrightarrow A$ for some set $X$. But since $\mathcal{C}$ is thin, every regular epimorphism must be an isomorphism. Also, $F(X)$ is a coproduct of copies of $F(1)$, which means it is either the initial object $0$ or $F(1)$ itself (since $\mathcal{C}$ is thin). If $F(1) \cong 0$, then every object is isomorphic to the initial object $0$, and hence $\mathcal{C}$ is trivial. If not, then $\mathcal{C}$ has exactly two objects up to isomorphism, $0$ and $F(1)$, there is a morphism $0 \to F(1)$, but no morphism $F(1) \to 0$. Since $\mathcal{C}$ is thin, we conclude $\mathcal{C} \simeq \{0 \to 1\}$.'

    'Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category with countable powers. Then for every object $X \in \mathcal{C}$ there is an object $P \in \mathcal{C}$ with $P \cong X \times P$ and which has a morphism $X \to P$.',
    'Take $P := X^{\mathbb{N}}$. Since $\mathbb{N} \cong 1 + \mathbb{N}$ as sets, we have $P \cong X \times P$. The diagonal provides a morphism $X \to P$.'

    'Uniqueness of preadditive structures',
    'Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a preadditive category (or more generally, a category enriched in commutative monoids) with finite products and finite coproducts. Then for all objects $X,Y$ the canonical morphism
    <p>$\alpha : X \oplus Y \to X \times Y$</p>
    is an isomorphism. Moreover, the preadditive structure is <i>unique</i>: If $f,g : A \rightrightarrows B$ are morphisms, their sum
    <p>$f+g : A \to B$</p>
    is the composite of $(f,g) : A \to B \times B$, the inverse $\alpha^{-1} : B \oplus B \to B \times B$, and the codiagonal $\nabla : B \oplus B \to B$.',
    'The morphism $\alpha : X \oplus Y \to X \times Y$ is defined by the equations
    <p>$p_1 \circ \alpha \circ i_1 = \mathrm{id}_X, \quad p_2 \circ \alpha \circ i_2 = \mathrm{id}_Y$</p>
    <p>$p_2 \circ \alpha \circ i_1 = 0,\quad p_1 \circ \alpha \circ i_2 = 0$.</p>
    It does not depend on the choice of preadditive structure since zero morphisms are unique. It is an isomorphism: Define
    <p>$\beta := i_1 \circ p_1  + i_2 \circ p_2 : X \times Y \to X \oplus Y$.</p>
    Then $\alpha \circ \beta = \mathrm{id}_{X \times Y}$ because
    <p>$p_1 \circ \alpha \circ \beta = p_1 \circ \alpha \circ i_1 \circ p_1 + p_1 \circ \alpha \circ i_2 \circ p_2 = \mathrm{id}_1 \circ p_1 + 0 \circ p_2 = p_1$</p>
    and likewise $p_2 \circ \alpha \circ \beta = p_2$. We also have $\beta \circ \alpha = \mathrm{id}_{X \oplus Y}$ with a very similar calculation that shows $\beta \circ \alpha \circ i_1 = i_1$ and $\beta \circ \alpha \circ i_2 = i_2$.
    <p>Therefore, for morphisms $f,g : A \rightrightarrows B$ the composite $A \to B$ in the claim is equal to</p>
    $\begin{aligned} \nabla \circ \beta \circ (f,g) & = \nabla \circ (i_1 \circ p_1  + i_2 \circ p_2) \circ (f,g) \\ & = \nabla \circ i_1 \circ p_1 \circ (f,g) + \nabla \circ i_2 \circ p_2 \circ (f,g) \\ & = p_1 \circ (f,g)  +  p_2 \circ (f,g) \\ & = f + g. \end{aligned}$'

    'In a category let $S$ be a generating set which is <a href="/category-property/strongly_connected">strongly connected</a> (between any two objects in $S$ there is a morphism). If the coproduct $U := \coprod_{G \in S} G$ exists, then it is a generator.',
    'This is a straight forward generalization of <a href="/category-implication/generator_via_coproduct">this result</a>. We remark that the assumption about $S$ implies that each inclusion $G \to U$ has a left inverse. Now let $f,g : A \rightrightarrows B$ be two morphisms with $f h = g h$ for all $h : U \to A$. If $G \in S$, any morphism $G \to A$ extends to $U$ by our preliminary remark. Thus, $fh = gh$ holds for all $h : G \to A$ and $G \in S$. Since $S$ is a generating set, this implies $f = g$.'

    'Limits in factor categories',
    'Let $\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D}$ be two categories. Assume that $\mathcal{D}$ is inhabited. If $\mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{D}$ has limits of a given shape, then $\mathcal{C}$ also has limits of this shape.',
    'Let $U \in \mathcal{D}$ be a fixed object. Assume that $X : \mathcal{J} \to \mathcal{C}$ is a diagram. Assume that the diagram $(X,U) : \mathcal{J} \to \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{D}$ (which is constant in the second variable) has a limit cone $((p_i, u_i) : (L,V) \to (X_i,U))$, thus consisting of morphisms $p_i : L \to X_i$ and $u_i : V \to U$. Clearly, $(p_i : L \to X_i)$ is a cone over $X$. We prove that it is universal:<br>
    Let $(f_i : T \to X_i)$ be a cone over $X$. Then $((f_i,\mathrm{id}_U) : (T,U) \to (X_i,U))$ is a cone over $(X,U)$. Hence, there is a unique morphism $(f,v) : (T,U) \to (L,V)$, consisting of $f : T \to L$ and $v : U \to V$, such that $(p_i,u_i) \circ (f,v) = (f_i,\mathrm{id}_U)$, i.e. $p_i \circ f = f_i$ and $u_i \circ v = \mathrm{id}_U$. If $g : T \to L$ is another morphism with $p_i \circ g = f_i$, then uniqueness applied to $(g,v)$ shows that $f = g$.'

Let $i_0 \in I$. We claim that $f_{i_0},g_{i_0} : A_{i_0} \rightrightarrows B_{i_0}$ are coequalized by all morphisms $B_{i_0} \to Q_{i_0}$, and hence are equal: Indeed, for all $i \neq i_0$ we may choose some morphism $B_i \to Q_i$ since $Q_i$ is weakly terminal. Thus, the morphism $B_{i_0} \to Q_{i_0}$ extends to a morphism $(B_i \to Q_i)_{i \in I}$ in the product category. By assumption, it coequalizes $(f_i)_{i \in I}$ and $(g_i)_{i \in I}$. By looking at the $i_0$-component are done.'
